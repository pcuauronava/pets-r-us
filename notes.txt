installed express-ejs-layouts
pages completed:
- grooming with the header and footer in the html part
grid with the divs as sections
div class item 1 as the section 1, etc
remember the set configuration for the express layouts should be called layout in singural not in plural,
it took me a while find this out because in the example the name of the folder is layouts and not layout
now be careful with the typing, even a separation can change the layout, for example when saved the file full-width.ejs
I did not separated the include from the dash after the porcentage sign and vs code took it the double point to be separated
from the dash (/) which is funny, vs code does not undertand the templating in html
next I removed all the information from the index page to avoid having double headers and footers and included only what was about
inside the body and added a title on the head section of the template
but the styling was lost so I had to include it on the template
I had to change the filenames of the header and footer files and move them to the upper folder
that also means I have to change the link to them
the example given by Raddy on this video helped me a lot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYVKbAn5Od0&t=2s
the only suggestion would be to make sure you make the difference of the setting with the location of the layouts in the app
an small script was included in the header partial views (remember the _templatefilename enforced best practice) giving the actual year
